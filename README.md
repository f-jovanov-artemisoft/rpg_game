#### A RPG "game" that i made on a course/interniship at Netcetera in 2018.

The objective of the task that was given to us was for us to make a RPG game, in which there'd be 4 "roles" : Mage, Warrior, Hunter and Cavalry. They should be able to move and attack with different movement and attack ranges(melee and ranged), some of them would have certain types of damage, and others would have certain defense against certain damage types.

Basically, implementing the fundamental game logic of an RPG game, without all the fancy stuff like abilities and graphics. Just a 2D array as the map, and each character being a letter.
